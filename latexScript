#!/bin/sh

# script that takes the name of a file as an argument and converts it to pdf with this command latexmk -xelatex latex/RapportDeStage.tex -outdir=pdf;xreader pdf/RapportDeStage.pdf

# Usage: ./latexScript.sh file.tex

# Check if the user has provided an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Please provide a file name"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the file provided exists
if [ ! -f $1 ]; then
    echo "File does not exist"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the file provided has the right extension
if [ "${1##*.}" != "tex" ]; then
    echo "Wrong file extension"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the file provided is in the right directory
if [ ! -d "latex" ]; then
    echo "Directory does not exist"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the pdf directory exists
if [ ! -d "pdf" ]; then
    mkdir pdf
fi

# Convert the tex file to pdf
latexmk -xelatex $1 -outdir=pdf
xreader pdf/${1%.tex}.pdf

# End of latexScript.sh
```

To make it executable, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x latexScript.sh
```

Now you can run the script with:

```bash
./latexScript.sh file.tex
```

The script will check if the file exists, if it has the right extension, if the directories exist, and then convert the tex file to a pdf file using `latexmk -xelatex` and open the pdf file with `xreader`.

## 3. Make a script to compile and run Java programs

You can also create a script to compile and run Java programs. The script will take the name of the Java file as an argument and compile and run it if the compilation is successful.

Here is an example of a Java script:

```bash
# Path: javaScript.sh
#!/bin/sh

# script that takes the name of a file as an argument and compiles and runs the Java program with this command: javac java/HelloWorld.java; java -cp java HelloWorld

# Usage: ./javaScript.sh HelloWorld.java

# Check if the user has provided an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Please provide a file name"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the file provided exists
if [ ! -f $1 ]; then
    echo "File does────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
